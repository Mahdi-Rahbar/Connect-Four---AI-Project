# Connect Four AI 

This project is the final project for the **Artificial Intelligence course**, implementing the **Connect Four** game with two AI algorithms:  
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**  

The game features a graphical interface using **Pygame**, an AI selection menu, smooth animations, and a scoring system to track performance.  

## üõ† Features  
‚úÖ Play against two different AI strategies  
‚úÖ Animated piece drops for a smooth experience  
‚úÖ Interactive main menu for AI selection  
‚úÖ Real-time score tracking for both player and AI  
‚úÖ Optimized decision-making using Minimax and MCTS  

## üì¶ Installation  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-four-ai.git
cd connect-four-ai
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the following dependencies:  
```sh
pip install numpy pygame
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Game  
```sh
python connect-four-minimax.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play  
- Select an AI algorithm from the menu.  
- Click on a column to drop your piece.  
- The AI will make its move automatically.  
- The game ends when a player gets **four in a row** (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).  

## ü§ñ AI Algorithms  

### Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- Explores possible moves up to a certain depth.  
- Evaluates board positions using a heuristic function.  
- Uses **pruning** to eliminate unnecessary calculations, improving efficiency.  

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  
- Simulates multiple random games to evaluate move strength.  
- Selects moves based on **exploration & exploitation** trade-offs.  
- Performs better in **longer-term strategy planning**.  

## üèÜ Which AI is Better?  
- **Minimax** is efficient for shorter decision depths and tactical play.  
- **MCTS** is better for **strategic** and **long-term planning**.  
- Try both and see which one challenges you more!
